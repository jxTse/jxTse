# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mathemetics & computer science
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AIGC and any other interesting things

### Cool things I did
- Participate in NUS School of Science Summer Workshop: The first time I go abroad alone. Study and live at a world-leading university really open my mind and horizons.
- Persist in writing and operate my own personal WeChat public account: Keep recording, meaning emerges naturally.
- Travel to almost all provinces in China: Always on the road.
